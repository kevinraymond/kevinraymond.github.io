Howdy. I'm Kevin. This is where I might write about random stuff I'm exploring, mostly AI and/or software related, but who knows what kind of adventures could show up here.

Ideally, posts will be short (2-3 minutes maybe) and informal. It's like a public notepad for side projects and curiosities.

I will call out if I use AI for something. I frequently do for commits and boilerplate and similar things, and often when I don't have a clue and want to accomplish something.
